<h1>Vulnerability Management - Introduction/Entry Level Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a project/lob aimed at understanding vulnerability management. Vulnerability management is the practice of identifying, analyzing and mitigating any vulnerabilities of software within an IT environment. It is an essential area of focus within cybersecurity for safeguarding computer and networks from potential attackers or threat actors that could leverage vulnerabilities to their advantage. I will be using Josh Madakor's tutorial on YouTube to guide me in this project.
